# Windows 8 Limited WiFi Fix
# MUST RUN AS ADMINISTRATOR

This is a simple fix for when Windows 8 randomly tells you your WiFi is Limited and does not actually work.
You ```MUST``` run the batch file as an Administrator for it to work.
After the file is finished, as you can see if you were to read the outcome of the code, you need to restart your computer for the code to take effect.

Let's hope it worked. ✌️
